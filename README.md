Application of visualization of data in python
One major shift is the widespread adoption of electronic dispatch systems that have replaced the VHF-radio dispatch systems of times past. These mobile data terminals are installed in each vehicle and typically provide information on GPS localization and taximeter state. Electronic dispatch systems make it easy to see where a taxi has been, but not necessarily where it is going. In most cases, taxi drivers operating with an electronic dispatch system do not indicate the final destination of their current ride.



Another recent change is the switch from broadcast-based (one to many) radio messages for service dispatching to unicast-based (one to one) messages. With unicast-messages, the dispatcher needs to correctly identify which taxi they should dispatch to a pick up location. Since taxis using electronic dispatch systems do not usually enter their drop off location, it is extremely difficult for dispatchers to know which taxi to contact.
